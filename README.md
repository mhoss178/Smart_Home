Smart Home Project
using ATMega 32 ,LCD ,One LED <bluetooth module and solenoid

first to enter the home and open the solenoid you need to enter a user name and password
then you will get a welcome message and get access on the led
if the password or the user name is wrong for several times the alarm will fire

thanks
